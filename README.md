# 🚀 Project Overview
CardShield AI is a complete fraud-detection system built using machine learning to classify credit card transactions as fraudulent or legitimate.
The system applies:
- ✔ Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
- ✔ Handling Class Imbalance using SMOTE
- ✔ Feature Scaling
- ✔ Train–Test Splitting
- ✔ Model Training (LR, RF)
- ✔ Performance Evaluation
This project follows a clean, modular, industry-style ML pipeline suitable for deployment or integration into financial software.

# 📂 Dataset
This notebook uses the popular Credit Card Fraud Detection Dataset, containing:
- 284,807 transactions
- 492 fraud cases
- Highly imbalanced data
- All features V1–V28 are PCA-transformed components
- Amount, Time, and target variable Class

# 📊 Project Pipeline
**1️⃣ Data Preprocessing**
- Remove null values
- Statistical analysis (describe())
- Feature inspection

**2️⃣ Handling Imbalance**
- Due to only 0.17% fraud cases, SMOTE is applied to oversample the minority class.

**3️⃣ Feature Scaling**
StandardScaler used for:
- Amount
- Time

**4️⃣ Model Training**
Implemented models:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier (Optimized: n_estimators=500)

# 🤖 Best Performing Model (Recommended)
<h2>
RandomForestClassifier(
    n_estimators=500,
    max_depth=None,
    min_samples_split=2,
    min_samples_leaf=1,
    random_state=42,
    n_jobs=-1
) </pre>

# 📈 Evaluation Metrics
The model is evaluated using:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-score
- Confusion Matrix

(Specific metric values are not included since you requested performance without explicit numbers.)

# 🛠 Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- SMOTE (imblearn)
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

# 🌟 Key Features
- ✔ Handles severe class imbalance
- ✔ Optimized Random Forest model
- ✔ Clean, modular ML pipeline
- ✔ Scalable & production-friendly
- ✔ Fully interpretable workflow

# 📜 Conclusion
**CardShield AI successfully identifies fraudulent credit card transactions using a robust machine-learning workflow.
By balancing the dataset with SMOTE and applying optimized models, the system achieves strong fraud-detection performance while maintaining reliability and interpretability.**

This project can be extended into real-time fraud detection systems or banking-level transaction monitoring tools.
